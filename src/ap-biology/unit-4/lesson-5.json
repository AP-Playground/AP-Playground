  "summary": "Can you imagine that the human body contains around 30 trillion cells, and yet starts as only one? So far in this course we've learned about how the body functions, but now it's time to learn how it's formed. Topic 4.5 goes over the processes that cells use to form and replicate themselves. Please keep note that this is not the same process that organisms use to mate (more on that in unit 5)",
