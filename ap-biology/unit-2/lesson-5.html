    <h1>2.5: Membrane Permeability</h1>
    <p>
      Cell membranes have special properties to help keep in, keep out, and transfer useful materials. The membrane can help maintain the pH in a cell, while restricting the movement of larger molecules like glucose. Topic 2.5 is about what can and cannot freely move through the cell membrane.

    <h2>Written Explanation</h2>
    <h3>Fluid Mosaic Model:</h3>

    <p>
      The cell membrane separates the cell interior from its environment. The membrane has a property called <b>selective permeability</b>, which means that it only lets certain substances freely pass through it. This is useful to the cell as it allows for conditions viable for life to be created in the cell, through the regulation of what can pass in and out of the cell through the membrane. The cell is able to control what can enter and leave the cell through the proteins it produces, making the cell membrane more than just semi permeable, but selectively permeable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The things that can freely pass through the membrane are small and nonpolar. Small molecules can more easily fit between the gaps between the phospholipids and other molecules in the membrane. Nonpolar molecules are less affected by the polar phospholipid heads. Small polar molecules are a small exception, not being blocked, but being slightly slowed in their movement across the membrane.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hydrophilic (polar) molecules, ions, and large molecules cannot pass through the membrane freely. They have to use membrane protein channels (more on that in 2.7).

    <h3>Cell Walls:</h3>

    <p>
      On top of having a cell membrane, plant cells also have cell walls, making it even more difficult for materials to move between cells. While the cell wall doesn't affect the permeability of small molecules, it still blocks large molecules. That's why cell walls have holes in them called <b>plasmodesmata</b> to allow for more movement.
