    <h1>2.3: Cell Size</h1>
    <p>
      Cells are small, really small. Very few cells can be seen with the naked eye, and those that can are as small as a speck of dust. This miniscule cell size is actually very intentional and very necessary. Topic 2.3 explains why cells are the size they are, and how this helps them function.

    <h2>Written Explanation</h2>
    <h3>Protein Production Chain:</h3>

    <p>
      <b>Surface area</b> is the size of the outer layer of an object. For example, a cube's surface area is the combined size of its 6 sides.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Volume</b> is the size of the space within an object. For example, the volume of a cube is its side length cubed.
    </p>
    <img src="/ap-biology/unit-2/diagrams/volume.svg">
    <i class="imgCaption">Diagram showing the volume of the objects in the diagram above</i>

    <p>
      The <b>surface area to volume ratio</b> (abbr. S.A. to V. ratio) is the ratio between an object's surface area and volume. This value compares how much it would take to cover an object with how much it would take to fill it. (Ex: S.A. = 6, V. = 1, ratio = 6/1)

    <h3>Why cells are smaller:</h3>

    <p>
      As you can see in the examples above, objects that are smaller tend to have higher ratios, and objects that are more spherical tend to have lower ratios.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a higher S.A. to V. ratio means that more material can be transferred from outside the cell to inside per unit of volume. Larger cells require much more food to function, but have a harder time getting enough because their surface areas are proportionally too small. Additionally, cells generate heat which must be removed over time, and the higher the surface area, the easier it is to let out heat. All these factors come together to make it evolutionarily beneficial to have many smaller cells as opposed to a few larger ones.

    <h3>How cells increase surface area:</h3>
    <p>
      The problem with a cell having a small size is that it can't fit much. This means cells and their organelles have a tough balancing act, trying to make the cell as small as possible to maximize surface area and be able to fit all the components necessary for life. To aid this balancing act, organelles have folds in their membranes (<b>membrane folds</b>). Membrane folds allow organelles to be larger while still transferring a large amount of material. These folds are present on the inner membranes of mitochondria (<b>cristae</b>), and on the ER.

    <p>
      Cells also have other ways to increase the transfer of food, heat, and waste across their cell membrane. <b>Stomata</b> are holes on the outside of plant organisms which allow gas and water to exit and enter the plant. <b>Vesicles</b> are membrane bound sacs that store material and make it easy to take things into and out of the cell.
