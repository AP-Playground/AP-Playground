    <h1>1.1: Structure of Water and Hydrogen Bonding</h1>
    <p>This entire lesson has to do with an essential component of life, water. Topic 1.1 covers the structure of water and some of its properties which make it such an important and life sustaining molecule, along with the fact that humans are composed of ~70% of it. This topic isn't mentioned very often in the AP Biology CED, yet it contains multiple essential concepts, such as <u>electronegativity</u> and <u>hydrogen bonds</u>. It is highly recommended that you go over chemistry fundamentals in the previous lesson.

    <h2>Written Explanation</h2>
    <p>
      Water's molecular formula is H2O, meaning it contains 2 hydrogen atoms (H2) and one oxygen atom (O). Hydrogen needs one more electron to fill its valence shell. Oxygen needs two more to fill its shell. This means both hydrogens can share their electrons with oxygen so that all 3 atoms are happy and their valence shells are full. This is called covalent bonding.

    <p>
      However, the electrons do not hover around the atoms equally. Oxygen has more protons than hydrogen and is thus <u>electronegative</u>, meaning it wants to hog electrons. Electronegativity generally increases as you move up and to the right on the periodic table, precisely where oxygen is located. This results in a partially negative charge on the side of the water molecule which contains the oxygen atom and a partially positive charge on the side of the hydrogen atoms. This makes water not just a covalent molecule, but a <u>polar</u> covalent molecule. (Polar meaning there is a partial charge.)

    <h3>Hydrogen Bonds:</h3>
    <p>
      Just like with magnets and electricity, opposite charges attract, and therefore, these partial charges allow the positive and negative sides of different water molecules to form bonds with each other. These are known as <u>hydrogen bonds</u> and they usually form between the oxygen atom of one molecule and the hydrogen atom of another. One water molecule can form up to 4 hydrogen bonds. (one per each hydrogen and 2 for each oxygen atom.) Important note: these bonds are quite weak, and this is the key to some of water's other properties. Note: hydrogen bonds can also form between hydrogen and fluorine or hydrogen and nitrogen.

    <h3>Cohesion and Adhesion:</h3>
    <p>
      First of all, water molecules like to stick to things using hydrogen bonds. When it sticks to itself, the property is called <u>cohesion</u>. This allows the tops of bodies of water to stick together, a concept known as <u>surface tension</u>. Surface tension provides a surface for some small bugs to walk on. Additionally, this property allows you to slightly overfill your cup. Secondly, when water sticks to polar molecules besides itself, the property is called <u>adhesion</u>. Water can only attach to other polar/charged substances (Recall that water and oil don't mix). You might see this when filling water into a glass cylinder. The water will creep slightly up the sides of the beaker, as the adhesion of the water to the glass is stronger than the pull of gravity. This also allows water to climb up a paper towel, an event known as <u>capillary action</u>. Lastly, water uses its adhesive and cohesive properties together to climb the stems of plants during <u>transpiration</u>, which is just a fancy word for evaporation from plants. Water is able to stick to the xylem tube of the stem through adhesion and pull itself up against gravity using cohesion, a process started by the power of the sun. Remember, these properties are only possible due to hydrogen bonding, which in turn are only possible due to water's polarity!

    <h3>Specific Heat:</h3>
    <p>
      Water also has a very high <u>specific heat</u>, meaning that to raise 1g of water by 1 degree Celsius, it requires more time and energy than raising 1g of  sand by 1°C. This means water takes both longer to warm up and cool down, which allows it to regulate temperature. This property of water helps creatures living in bodies of water and also acts as the reason for coastal cities' more moderate climates. The reason for this high specific heat lies in the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Before the temperature of the water can be raised, the bonds between water molecules have to be broken. This allows water to absorb a lot of heat before the bonds actually break and the temperature is raised. Moreover, this energy absorption also takes part in <u>evaporative cooling</u>. When you sweat, the water on your skin absorbs energy from the sun, so that when it eventually evaporates the energy is dissipated and you are left feeling cooler.

    <h3>Density:</h3>
    <p>
      Next, water has a <u>lower density as a solid than liquid</u>. Thus, when you place ice into water, it will float. Just think of a cool drink on a summer day. This is interesting because in most substances the solid form is more dense than the liquid, meaning they will sink instead of float. This property of water is caused by water molecules spacing out to form a crystalline structure as it cools down and results in the safety of animals living in ponds and lakes, as when the body of water freezes over in the winter the ice is situated at the top, allowing life to continue below it.

    <h3>Solvent properties:</h3>
    <p>
      Lastly, water is considered to be an almost universal <u>solvent</u>. A solvent is a substance that dissolves another substance (the <u>solute</u>) to form a <u>solution</u>. Water can dissolve almost any substance that is polar or has a charge. Substances such as these are called <u>hydrophilic</u>, or water loving. Those which dislike water and are non-polar are <u>hydrophobic</u>. A common example of water dissolving a substance is putting salt into water and watching it dissolve. Salt's chemical formula is NaCl, and it is formed through an ionic bond between the sodium ion (Na<sup>+</sup>) and the chlorine ion (Cl<sup>-</sup>). When placed into water, the positive sodium ion gets bonded to the partially negatively charged oxygen atom, while the negative chlorine ion becomes attracted to the partially positively charged hydrogen atoms within water. As the water molecules arrange themselves around the two ions, the difference in how they attach to the ions result in a separation of the two ions and a cleavage of the ionic bond within salt, dissolving it. Water's power as a solvent also allows it to take nutrients with it as it travels through the water cycle.
