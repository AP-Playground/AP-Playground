    <h1>4.2: Introduction to Signal Transduction</h1>
    <p>
      Last lesson, we were introduced to the signal transduction pathway. We learned about the general concepts and terms that are related to signal movement. Topic 4.2 delves deeper into the specifics of transduction, providing examples of each step of the process.

    <h3>Types of Receptors:</h3>

    <p>
      Receptor proteins can be located either inside the cell, or on the outer membrane surface. Intracellular (inside the cell) receptors typically bind small hydrophobic ligands known as <b>steroid hormones</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Cell surface receptors</b> are integral proteins that typically bind to hydrophobic/charged ligands. Their extracellular surface is what receives the signal, and the intracellular surface is what transfers the message to the cell.

          <h2>Ligand-gated ion channels</h2>
          <p>When this receptor binds to its ligand, the receptor opens a gate, allowing ions to enter/exit the cell. The charge and concentration of the ions can continue the signal transduction pathway or elicit a cellular response.</p>

    <h3>Types of Transduction:</h3>

    <p>
      Now that the cell has received a signal, it needs to move and modify it to its destination. This can take many different forms in different cells and for different types of signals, but a few of the important ones are listed below.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a cell receives a signal, it may be very weak, or be far from its destination of causing a cellular response. To amplify the signal, a transduction pathway may use a <b>phosphorylation cascade</b>. In a phosphorylation cascade, the initial reception results in the activation of a <b>kinase</b>, by phosphorylating it (adding a phosphate group to it). Then, that activated kinase activates another few kinases, <u>cascading</u> through the cell, and amplifying the signal. Eventually, the activated kinases will fully transfer the signal and trigger a response. When the response occurs, cells usually use the enzyme <b>phosphatase</b> to deactivate the kinases.
    </p>

    <i class="imgCaption">Diagram of phosphorylation cascade</i>

    <p>
      Another way to pass the message from reception to destination is with <b>second messengers</b>. These small, non-protein molecules are released by a receptor and transduct the message.
    </p>
