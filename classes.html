          <p>The Advanced Placement Biology course takes beginner biology concepts and expands on them, giving students a comprehensive overview of the life on Earth. The course begins with a unit on chemistry that is needed to understand biology, followed by cellular structure, function, processes, and communication. The largest chunk of the course focuses on genetics, explaining heredity, gene expression, and natural selection. The course finishes with ecology, explaining the interactions between organisms. Our course is centered on preparing students for the AP Biology exam, which consists of both multiple choice questions and free response questions on various prompts.</p>
