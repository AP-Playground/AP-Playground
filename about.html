    <h1>Our Mission:</h1>
    <p>
      Being students ourselves, we understand that not every teacher can teach, explain, and review every topic you need to know for the AP test (or in general for that matter). Even when you have an excellent teacher, there are still road bumps with certain topics and time limits. For this reason and others, AP-Study exists. We aim to assist current and future students with an enriching learning and study experience.
    </p>
    <h1>How we recommend you use AP-Study:</h1>
    <p>
      For teachers: Use this program as a supplement to your lessons. We cover every topic specified by college board in detail, both in video and written form. You can also have your students do our practice MCQ quizzes. Scores are not recorded and questions are (usually) not the same every attempt, so students can practice the material multiple times. Additionally, every question comes with an explanation on why the answer is what it is. The questions are both regular test and college board level, so students can practice a multitude of question difficulties and reinforce their knowledge of the material before attempting an AP level question. However, our site is not set up to be used as testing, and should only be used for teaching/practice material. New lessons and courses are always being added, so if your course or the lesson you want to supplement isnâ€™t on here, check again in a couple of months!
