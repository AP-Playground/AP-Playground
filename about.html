    <h1>Our Mission:</h1>
    <p style="text-indent: 3ch;">
      Being students ourselves, we understand that not every teacher can teach, explain, and review every topic you need to know for the AP test (or in general for that matter). Even when you have an excellent teacher, there are still road bumps with certain topics and time limits. For this reason and others, AP-Study exists. We aim to assist current and future students with an enriching learning and study experience.
    </p>
    <h1>How we recommend you use AP-Study:</h1>
    <p style="text-indent: 3ch;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">For teachers:</span> Use this program as a supplement to your lessons. We cover every topic specified by college board in detail, both in video and written form. You can also have your students do our practice MCQ quizzes. Scores are not recorded and questions are (usually) not the same every attempt, so students can practice the material multiple times. Additionally, every question comes with an explanation on why the answer is what it is. The questions are both regular test and college board level, so students can practice a multitude of question difficulties and reinforce their knowledge of the material before attempting an AP level question. However, our site should not be used for a grade, and should only be used for learning/practice material. If you think there is missing information in a lesson, please fill out the form below.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 3ch;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">For students:</span> We know that sometimes a certain lesson needs some reviewing, or a doctor’s appointment gets in the way of attending a class. For these purposes, AP-Study exists. Through its various methods of topic reviewing, this program is designed for not only meeting College Board standards, but also to help you get a deeper understanding of the content. Test prep, rewatching a lesson that doesn’t make sense the first time around, and questions to reinforce knowledge are all ways AP-Study can help. Our extensive catalog of external resources can also help in these regards, from videos and articles from big names including Crash Course, Khan Academy, and Bozeman Science.
