      <h1>Our Mission:</h1>
      <p>
        Being students ourselves, we understand that not every teacher can teach, explain, and review every topic you need to know for the AP test (or in general for that matter). Even when you have an excellent teacher, there are still road bumps with certain topics and time limits. For this reason and others, AP-Study exists. We aim to assist current and future students with an enriching learning and study experience. Even if you aren't taking a class, or planning on taking it, we hope you can learn something new from our site.
      </p>
      <h1>How we recommend you use AP-Study:</h1>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">For students:</span> No matter where you are in a course, we highly recommend you watch the course's introductory video. Doing so will help you figure out what information you may have missed or want to expand on. When/if you know what you want to learn, you should watch the lesson's video and/or read its article and then try out the quiz. If you need more help, you can check the external lesson resources. If all you want to do is review, you can just go through every lesson one by one doing only the quiz.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">For teachers:</span> Use this program exclusively as a supplement to your lessons. We cover every topic specified by the College Board in detail, both in video and written form, so the lesson you are looking for is likely there. Quizzes are at both regular test and college board level, so they can help students verify their knowledge of the material. However, scores are not recorded.
